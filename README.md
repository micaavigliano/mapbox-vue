## Frontend challenge for Ceres Imaging

This is a simple earthquake seach feature consuming the data from [USGS API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/#parameters)

### Installing dependencies

1. clone the repo
2. run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies
3. run `npm run serve` to build the local environment

### Stack

This project was develop using vue mapbox, vuex and vuetify

- This was my first time using some of these technologies, so I wanted to give it a try. I had to have an intensive ramp-up in order to make it work.

- I decided to use vuex to manage the states because it was the easiest and cleanest way to manipulate the states and propagate the data between the components.

- I could not complete the `circle-radius` part, because I could not handle layers once the data was loaded on the map after performing the search. I will continue investigating on that and once I have it done I will push it.

### Functionability

The user is able to perfom a search by given three endpoints: `starttime`, `endtime` and `minmagnitude`. These endpoints will submit the filter and return all the data that was requested
